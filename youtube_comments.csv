It’s almost painful to witness how blatantly Kenyans are being lied to by  Mr. Ichung’wah.<br><br>Having lived in Kenya for almost five years, I’ve seen firsthand how deeply corruption is entrenched in nearly every aspect of daily life. It’s a reality that every Kenyan knows all too well. I always called it the “country of middlemen” because, in truth, the moment someone gains even the slightest bit of power, the temptation to exploit it often overwhelming.<br><br>From police officers fabricating offenses to extort bribes, to the absolute chaos at Nyayo House, where obtaining a visa or permit can take years unless you’re willing to pay the premiums —corruption isn’t just an issue in Kenya, it’s the system itself.<br><br>How can people be expected to trust in institutions when the political establishment lies so brazenly to its own citizens? <br><br>In my opinion trust cannot exist in a system where integrity is an illusion and power is merely a gateway to self-enrichment."

Let us reduce MPs terms to 3 years so they don&#39;t ride on the presidential ticket all the time.  We need to remind them they work for Kenyans BUT NOT their stomachs like the ODM members who were elected to Governments positions and went to fill their stomachs and hve began lecturing Kenyans eti they are not NGO for fighting for humanity BUT political party looking for POWER. Shindweni milele. No wonder Raila was defeated at AU due to domestic feudes and luck of streamlined policy on sensitive issues of Governance. But game shot 2027 we are there again on the BOX to clean the mess once again.

The economy is in shambles now more than ever, and affording a meal has become a struggle under this government. It’s hard to point out a single positive achievement—just oppression and hardship.<br>As a Kenyan earning less than KSh 25,000, my heart aches. I can’t even begin to imagine what it’s like for those who are jobless or unable to afford a meal. We’re merely surviving; calling it &quot;living&quot; would be an overstatement.<br>Meanwhile, our so-called &quot;hustler&quot; president has donated millions to a church—not that supporting the church is wrong, but it’s an institution that is already well-off. His priorities and governance approach are deeply questionable. Civil servants are going home without pay due to a lack of funds, yet that money could have significantly impacted places like Turkana and other underprivileged areas. But because we want to be seen as &quot;God-chosen&quot; and righteous, we direct funds to the church instead of addressing urgent national needs. Smh."

547,@Wamzzzie,2025-03-03T10:00:31Z,2025-03-03T10:00:31Z,1,"Kimani Ichung&#39;wah&#39;s performance was not particularly convincing. He came across as evasive, defensive, and unwilling to take responsibility for the shortcomings of the current government. His reliance on deflecting blame and downplaying serious issues likely reinforced negative perceptions of the government.  <br>Lack of Direct Answers:He repeatedly avoided giving straight answers, particularly regarding the fulfillment of specific promises from the election manifesto. This damaged his credibility, as the interviewer pointed out.<br>Defensiveness and Evasiveness:He often deflected criticism by attacking the source of the information (e.g., Mehdi, Human Rights Watch) rather than directly addressing the substance of the claims.<br>Downplaying Serious Issues:He appeared to downplay the severity of issues like police brutality and abductions, using phrases like &quot;lives had to be lost&quot; and suggesting some abduction claims were fabricated. This came across as insensitive and out of touch.<br>Reliance on &quot;Claims&quot; Narrative:He frequently used the word &quot;claims&quot; to describe allegations of state-sponsored violence and disappearances, creating the impression that he was unwilling to acknowledge the possibility of government wrongdoing.<br>Blaming the Opposition/Previous Government:He often attributed problems to the previous administration or political opponents, which can be seen as a way to avoid taking responsibility for the current government&#39;s actions.<br>Contradictory Statements:There were instances where his statements seemed inconsistent, such as initially saying he would not give a straight answer and then claiming to have the answer."
548,@Wamzzzie,2025-03-03T09:58:20Z,2025-03-03T09:58:20Z,1,"Analysis of this interview: Ichungwa&#39;s Attitude Towards Ordinary Kenyans:<br>Out of Touch:His downplaying of issues like police brutality, abductions, and the cost of living suggests a potential disconnect from the everyday struggles of ordinary Kenyans.<br>Dismissive of Concerns:His tendency to attribute criticism to political opponents or &quot;perception&quot; could be interpreted as a dismissal of the genuine concerns of ordinary Kenyans.<br>Patronizing:At times, his responses come across as patronizing, as if he believes ordinary Kenyans are easily misled or don&#39;t understand the complexities of governing.<br>Tone-Deaf:While he highlights the government&#39;s efforts to improve the economy, he doesn&#39;t seem to fully grasp the public&#39;s skepticism and frustration, suggesting a potential lack of empathy."

For instance it&#39;s a phenomenon in Kenya that a police officer will stop commercial vehicles takes a bribe without checking even the documents validity. The reason Mr. Ichungwa won&#39;t tell you this is because the money the police collects get into the pockets of the officers upwards in the chain of command. From the police who collects it to probably police Inspector General.

Thirty hours later I was deported and blacklisted- to make sure I would not be able to return to Kenya.<br>The police is corrupt through and through as is the judiciary - so who in his right mind honestly believes, that police officers are goi g to be held accountable for any kind of crime in Kenya?"

This is a majority leader in an independent parliament responsible for overseeing all government institutions in Kenya.

All of them are the same there is no angel; they should be voted out come next election. We are tired of being plays as pawns, never being listened to, having leaders with no regard or care in the world for their citizens or nation rather than their own personal interests and close circle.

Mehdi Hasan did an incredible job asking the tough, critical questions that too many journalists here in Kenya fear to ask. The way he tackled the cost-of-living crisis, the finance bill, and the government’s harsh response to protests was both eye-opening and long overdue. As a Kenyan, it’s exhausting to watch our leaders dodge accountability, but this kind of bold journalism gives me real hope for change. Huge kudos to Al Jazeera for shining a light on these issues and holding power to account. Please keep delivering fearless reporting like this—we need it now more than ever!"

The white Europeans caused such damages of stealing, looting our resouces , destroyed our structures and enslaved our people. The African leaders have learned from the white man to steal, corruption and be puppets for the West! <br><br>Listen you so called people calling yourself children of Yaweh and believers in Christ. God needs righteous people and believers to rule and take over governments. The world, governments are being ruled by the devil&#39;s children. You are busy praying to go to heaven....God wants us to rule to ensure people dont suffer. Get involved in ruling and get rid of these wicked leaders who dont care. The Europeans dont want Africa to succeed because they fear us. We need to stand. In Genesis, God said we should rule and dominate. He has given us authority and power. Psalm 8. Power to rule over earth, sky and water. Believers of Christ stop saying the earth is not ours. God made the earth for us. The world is in a mess, Africa is a mess because satan worshippers are in charge. We need to bring the government of Jesus on the earth. Isaiah 9.

They are too comfortable with these negative traits. I watched this through gritted teeth in hopes one day beautiful Kenya will reach its potential. The religion and politics is killing that country, more than the money and greed. Money and greed is evidently evil in all its forms.

Being a Kenyan, I think the issue of bribes is a culture problem. We focus too much on the officers taking the bribes (not saying they shouldn&#39;t be punished for that); however, go to the streets and ask or observe any Kenyan caught on the wrong side of the law ,, or needs to have something or a process they need expedited, they themselves will end up asking whoever is in charge how much they want for them to let them go or expedite things for them by helping jump the queue ; or exploit the fact that whoever is in charge knows them. <br>That culture is not in enforcement officers alone,, but also in the bigger portion of ordinary &#39;Mwananchi&#39; (Kenyan).

The amount was small, a few dollars. The driver had been spotted using his mobile phone. I told him that in Australia the fine for such use of the phone would be in the 400-500 range, not 2-3 dollars. On balance I think Australia is more corrupt than Kenya. The government take far more in Australia from you for minor misdemeanours than they do in Kenya. And as for the Politican being rich, with 1,000,000,000 Kenyan Shilling. That only equates to about $11 million AUD. Peter Dutton is allegedly worth $230 million AUD and he isn&#39;t even PM yet. Australian politicians seems to come into very nice jobs, with millions in pensions and benefits. On balance I am inclined to believe that Kenya was a very well structured growing developing nation with a healthy futire. Whereas Australia is an over inflated, expensive and bueracratically corrupt country, where taxing, fining, and over legilslating amounts to far worse consequencies than those mentioned in Kenya."

If anything it threw sympathy on the guest. The range of questions was limited and did not paint a wide enough view of the topic, in order to offer light on it. Sadly it reflects on the interviewer, that he came with a predisposition to berate his guest with. He might ask himself what is the point of inviting a guest, if you are not allowing them to reply unhindered. A good interviewer might have allowed the guest to speak more, then suggested that they offer their opinion as to why they believe what they do. Instead this interviewer continued a remorseless tirade of opinion. Last year I was in Nairobi during the riots. Most taxi and Uber drivers stated that they were neither concerned or surprised at the demonstrations, and that they were a symptom of a large body of youth, who had no jobs. To understand the police treatment would have been a more useful line of questioning, than to draw the guest into a polarized denial of government culpability. Kilmani was gracious and atttempted to answer. Guest 8/10 Interviewer 2/10."

Lucrative than be a teacher, an inventor, a scientist, etc. You have politicians saying casually how they are billionaires without any known business (product or service they offer) to their name. It is just tenderpreneurship and we import things, we don&#39;t create or manufacture. Secondly, it is the Ruto presidency that commits these crimes. However, Kenyans are to be blamed for what is happening in Kenya. For the last three election cycles, they have voted for two ICC criminals and the current president even campaigned against the new, progressive constitution. What did they expect? The ICC criminals are not free because they were found innocent but because witnesses disappeared, showed up dead, or were put in fear. In fact, as they were electing the crooks, they rejected Pro CHANGE forces. Lastly, his regime did not campaign on the platform of getting rid of corruption. That should have been an eye opener to Kenyans. His regime had a lot of corrupt individuals, including the president who has been mentioned in several corruption cases."

At the end of the interview you are agreeing that it&#39;s the former deputy president. You&#39;re not saying the truth. <br><br>Second, corruption in Kenya is soo deep and you don&#39;t want to agree to that. Infact you&#39;re saying that the giver is on the wrong that&#39;s why police ask for bribe. Indirectly you are accepting the Police are corrupt. Police choose to harass the person on the wrong to get the bribe instead of following the proper disciplinary steps.<br><br>Unfortunately I have been involved in corruption and I had done nothing wrong. I attended my driving classes for more than a month. In my mind I didn&#39;t want to pay for it which some people do even without attending any driving class. During the final exam I passed the theory part and was to go for the practical. Upon reaching to the vehicle to be used for the practicals I was told they&#39;ve lost my file and they can&#39;t find it. Spent whole day tracing it without success. Finally I was told if I pay they can look for it well. Got my license without doing the practical exam. Sooo bad and can&#39;t imagine it had to end thay way."

They had been there for a half hour waiting for me to get my bags. But they said if I didn&#39;t pay they would have his car towed. It was very late at night it had taken a whole day to get here, three planes. They were all( four of them) sitting on a bench just taking money from every person they wanted too.

The truth is he William ruto directly sabotaged the previous government till they had to change currency. He massively looted as a deputy. He kimani leads a very small constituency yet the budget for roads is among the highest in the country and still it has so many roads already done.

Denying documented cases of enforced disappearances and unlawful detentions only reinforces the perception that the government is unwilling to address its failures. Evasive responses about the administration’s progress on campaign promises further expose a lack of transparency and commitment to real change. If the government truly values democracy, it must stop deflecting criticism and start addressing the genuine concerns of its people."

The government should come out clear whether they are in-charge or not. I am 100% sure they know the different agencies conducting the abductions and EJK and have given their blessing for the atrocities to be done in plain sight.

But since President Ruto took over, everything is so tense, even the kenyan people themselves are harsher because the conditions of living now are much tougher. Prices of things have all gone up, rent charges have gone up, on top of that killings everywhere. I have no specific solution but I would suggest the government refer and see how things used to be done. Sometimes old is gold."

Seldom will you hear the civil commend the incumbent government. Anyway there&#39;s much the government has done and more that&#39;s to be done, but my take is this is a long journey and the baby steps are noticeable. Also next time do more on active listening and allow the interviewee to respond to questions. I believe you don&#39;t live in the country so the best way to learn about it is to listen... i like al jazeera though"

If  the investigative agencies were competent and independent then they would have opened a case against the president when Mr.Muturi said that the president made a phone call to the head of DCI then his son was released after that phone call because the president should have sacked the head of the DCI for holding someone without due process but the president did not do what a competent administrator would have done. Also if the investigative agencies were competent and independent then they would have already opened a case against the president for the recent allegations of Gold smuggling from Sudan through Kenya. And if the investigative agencies were independent and competent then there would have been an investigation to the allegations that Murkomen was caught in Dubai with billions in cash, Ruto flew to Dubai to negotiate for his release and flew back with him, to date there has never been any investigations and worse the opposition is pretending that it doesn&#39;t know about this allegation. So far no investigations, so you can see why there are no major scandals under Ruto. The NIS, DCI and the Interior ministry are part of the big cover-up."

RUTO and Raila were partners in crime in 2007! That is why there was bloodshed, because Uhuru Kenyatta was there enemy!!! To prove these men are all lying, Ruto was back in bed politically with Raila in 2024 pushing for his AU chairperson candidature, and they have now signed a secret pact together! <br>So what is Ruto lying about &quot;inheriting&quot; a decrepit country.

We get that some Kikuyus (Not all of them) who are from Congo disagree. Many of who have been causing problems. I mean look at the situation in DRC with a lack of leadership. Our EAC chairman continues to make efforts to bring solutions even beyond borders. We also don’t expect to solve Haiti’s decades old problems but we answered their cry for help when many ignored them. No country is perfect.

He was trying to be diplomatic but he came off as cheesy and dubious. Oh Ichung&#39;wa was a complete DISASTER. Terrible prep, terrible optics, terrible safe politics, terrible answers. He should go hide in the toilet till we call his name. Horrible performance!!! And I say this as a fan.<br><br>For the first time I will say Mehdi got his math wrong. My guy Mehdi never gets it wrong. but this one he... umm... he missed. I understand why he missed it so badly. Kenya&#39;s situation is a bit bizarre. It&#39;s operating backwards. Usually the govt is the presumed bad guy. Ordinarily. But in Kenya those civil society groups are the predators and the govt is the one trying to stop them from hunting and exploiting Kenyans. They formed systems of exploiting Kenyans and their status quo is getting disturbed. Let me substantiate to lend some credibility.<br><br>Do you know in Kenya only 10% of the population can get a mortgage? 90% can beg and wail all they want, no bank will ever ever ever ever give them a mortgage facility. The only way people can ever own a house is if they inherit then the whole family splits up the land or they just rent till the day they will save enough to build with cash. Pesident Ruto decided instead of forcing banks to give people mortgages, he would build houses and people can buy at just a THIRD of the market rate. Buying houses in the market demands 70% upfront and the balance within THREE months. But Ruto&#39;s houses you just pay 10% then pay whayever rent you can till the balance is cleared and the house is yours. No interest rate. Sounds good, right? Those Civil Society groups have been fighting it in court. They oppose 1.5% levy. What the heck is 1.5% surely? If I save that all my life it can&#39;t buy me a house. But if we pool it with the govt we can get a house even tomorrow morning. Yeah, they will fight it.<br><br><br><br>They fight Univesal Healthcare too (same story as Obamacare). Most Kenyans have ZERO healthcare insurance. None at all. Most have never known such a thing even exists. People are one illness from poverty. You fall ill. vultures are there to buy your livestock, land and property at throw away prices. The previous healthcare system had just 9 million subscribers, mainly paycheck people - in a country where 80% are informal sector, ie. no loans, no mortgages, no credit facilities and no paychecks. Ruto has a new people-crafted system (yes the people designed it - we can discuss that later) that caters to EVERYONE, formal sector, informal, jobless, bums everyone is covered. Despite all the attempts to block it in court or badmouth it with social media propaganda, the new system has almost TRIPLE the subscribers of the old system. <br><br>These fellows even oppose needy children being given meals in school for Ksh 5 ($0.04). Those you trusted as the voice of the people are usually just that. But in Kenya we have some weird backwards thing and they are actually the vultures. The only legit person there was Irungu Haughton. The rest nobody even knows who the heck they are. Mehdi Mehdi Mehdi. Welcome to the Kenyan Experience. Boy did you get it wrong. Next time be more alert. <br><br>And Ichung&#39;wa sucked big time. BOO that guy."

The problem with telling lies so often is that at some point, even the liar genuinely can&#39;t tell the difference between his lies and the truth. Now, the worst part of being a narcissistic and pathological liar is that people often read you like a song book. They can, from a far, always see how the lies are conjured and concocted bit by bit and all they have to do is to simply pull off a single string and the web of lies crambles on its own weight. <br>Many thanks to Mehdi for doing the Lord&#39;s work.

Ethiopia descended into chaos because the citizens started accepting people getting killed as a norm because of false promises of the prime minister. An entire ethnic group suffered a genocide while the rest of Ethiopian citizens pretended like nothing is happening. If you let your government get away with these murders more and more will die and the citizens will become desensitized and start accepting these death. You’re the last hope for a working democracy in the region. I beg you my Kenyan brother and sisters continue fighting for your rights and maybe you can become an inspiration for other countries in the region including the native country Ethiopian"

In recent years, both President William Samoei Ruto and National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah have been implicated in several corruption scandals that have raised significant concerns about their leadership and commitment to good governance in Kenya.<br><br>1. William Ruto&#39;s Corruption Scandals<br><br>Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) Scandal: In 2023, the KEMSA was embroiled in a scandal involving the mismanagement of Ksh. 3.7 billion allocated for the procurement of mosquito nets. Allegations pointed to irregular tender awards and inflated prices, leading to public outcry and demands for accountability within President Ruto&#39;s administration. <br>NTV KENYA<br><br>Taxation and Governance Issues: President Ruto&#39;s tenure has been marked by widespread protests over high taxation and perceived poor governance. In response to these protests, he dismissed nearly all of his Cabinet ministers in February 2025, promising to form a leaner and more efficient government. This move was seen by many as an attempt to quell public dissent and address the corruption allegations plaguing his administration. <br>STAR TRIBUNE<br><br>Dismissal of High-Profile Cases: There have been instances where corruption cases involving close associates of President Ruto, amounting to approximately KSh 30 billion, have been withdrawn or dismissed. This pattern raises questions about the administration&#39;s dedication to combating graft within its ranks. <br><br>2. Kimani Ichung’wah&#39;s Corruption Allegations<br><br>Kitisuru Falls Residence Project: Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah has faced allegations regarding the rapid construction of a luxurious apartment complex known as the Kitisuru Falls Residence. Critics, including blogger and activist Francis Gaitho, have questioned the source of funding for this project, suggesting it may be linked to corrupt activities. The six towering 14-floor apartments reportedly sprang up in record time, raising suspicions about their financing and construction processes. <br><br>Wealth Accumulation: In a recent interview, Ichung’wah disclosed his net worth to be close to Ksh. 1 billion, attributing his wealth to various business ventures and prior employment before his political career. This revelation has sparked debates about the correlation between his political position and his substantial wealth, with some questioning the legitimacy of his financial gains. <br><br><br>These cases highlight the pressing need for transparency and accountability within Kenya&#39;s leadership. The allegations against both President Ruto and Majority Leader Ichung’wah underscore the challenges the nation faces in combating corruption and restoring public trust in its institutions.<br><br>Sources:<br>[Just look up the articles]<br>5 Scandals that Make William Ruto Unfit for President<br><br>The graft burden: Four major scandals in the Ruto administration<br><br>Ruto’s big shots freed from Sh30 billion fraud, tax suits<br><br>Ruto&#39;s govt on the spot: Kimani Ichung&#39;wah, other MPs admit SHA&#39;s failure<br><br>&#39;They must fall&#39;: Kimani Ichung&#39;wa reveals gov&#39;t plans to combat corruption in judiciary"

Picking solely from the discussions, MP ichungwah constantly refers to these abductions as &quot;allegations&quot;. However, in the same breath the president of Kenya and HIS party leader spoke publicly in December and said &quot;What has been said about abductions, we will stop them so Kenyan youth can live in peace, but they should have discipline and be polite so that we can build Kenya together,” This in itself is a blatant admission that these ARE in fact state sanctioned abductions. So who are Kenyans meant to believe from the two???? We have seen the Kenyan ministry of foreign affairs take part in forceful repatriation THROUGH abductions of the 4 turkish nationals who were in fact seeking asylum in Kenya from the Erdoğan administration. The abduction of Uganda&#39;s Kizza Besigye that was ENABLED by the Kenyan National Intelligence Service. The attempted abduction of Tanzanian activist, Maria Sarungi. And the list goes on. <br>If we have institutions in place that are supposedly working well, why is the Kenyan government months later STILL unable to show the Kenyan people <del>WITH EVIDENCE</del> who are behind these abductions? It took them a couple of days to supposedly identify who the serial killer behind the kware murders were but when it comes to issues such as abductions and extra judicial killings is where they draw the line? Kimani please!!!!<br>I wish there would be a part 2 of this interview with this said individual where we could continue to talk about all things failing in this state in terms of institutions i.e education, health, political elitism, corruption/ misappropriation of our taxes and even talk about the criminal elites running this fraudulent government!

The sarcasm could imply that the shoes—or the person wearing them—are trying too hard to impress, or that the expense is ridiculous for something as simple as footwear. It’s a backhanded compliment, like saying, &quot;Oh, great, you’ve got expensive taste—good for you,&quot; with an eye roll baked in. Context matters, though—who’s saying it and why could shift the vibe from playful to shady."

Kenyans have habits of accusing genuine business people that they are wash wash the same leaders in Kenya have been corrupt for many years and it’s only now with the more educated youth pointing these issue out. The fact is the vast population of Kenyan is still very uneducated and so are the politicians. Nothing is changing anytime soon in Kenyan and the African continent.

The perennial cycle of egregious corruption, gross mismanagement, and flagrant impunity in Kenya’s governance is both infuriating and disheartening. Year after year, we are inundated with scandals, grand theft of public resources, and empty rhetoric from leaders who feign concern while perpetuating systemic rot. Infrastructure crumbles, essential services deteriorate, and the common citizen is left to languish in economic despair. Yet, the architects of this dysfunction remain untouchable, shielded by a broken system that rewards incompetence and deceit. How much longer must we endure this blatant betrayal? When will leadership cease to be a self-enrichment scheme and instead serve its true purpose—uplifting the people? We need to see a  better Kenya!"

But the George Soros Brigade that has been invited to react to him is no good either. The whole conversation - both sides - is wrongly panelled. The host is also extremely biased &amp; hostile to the guest. I don&#39;t like Ruto&#39;s government but it deserves to be critiqued with objectivity.

At the time, William Ruto was the Minister for Agriculture in the Grand Coalition government.<br><br>2. HUSTLER’ JET SCANDAL<br>This scandal took place in May 2013, a month after the Jubilee Government took power.<br>Deputy President William Ruto allegedly hired a private jet for KES 100 million for his ‘shuttled diplomacy’ in West Africa. The trip was to lobby West African countries to support their cause at the International Criminal Court.<br><br>3. LANG’ATA PRIMARY SCHOOL LAND GRAB<br>William Ruto’s name featured prominently in the scandal. Some ‘faceless’ developers tried to grab the Lang’ata Primary School playground in 2015. He initially denied owning the Weston Hotel, which attempted to convert the playground to a parking lot.<br>The police responded ruthlessly and tear-gassed innocent schoolchildren. The aftermath was public outcry locally and around the world on how the police handled the protest.<br><br>4. THE KENYA PIPELINE LAND SCAM<br>William Ruto and four other persons faced fraud charges in court. The charges involved the alleged sale of a piece of land in Ngong forest to Kenya Pipeline Company Ltd for Sh272 million. The accusers argued that Ruto and his cohorts acquired and sold the land illegally.<br><br>5. MOI TEACHING AND REFERRAL HOSPITAL (MTRH) SCANDAL<br>A Nairobi businessperson linked Ruto to a controversial KES 28 billion deal. The businessperson, Hebert Ojwang’, said the deal was to put up a new referral hospital in Eldoret."
